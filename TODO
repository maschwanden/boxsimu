TODO:

- make nice plot interface
- incorporate processes and fluxes
- incorporate reactions
- make reactions stop if one of the educts is not available anymore
- make gui
- stability criterion for timesteps?!
- Make a way to specify input concentrations of flows from outside the system
- Make a way to specify wheter a flow that goes outside the system transports variables with it or not: E.g. evaporation of surface ocean water will not transport significant amounts of nutrients or salinity into the atmosphere were on the other hand a flow from a multi-lake model into the ocean will for sure transport significant amounts of nutrients.
- Think about a way to calculate the timestep more efficient:
