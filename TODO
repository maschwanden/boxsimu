TODO:
- Write all System functions new as: 
  -> 1Dlist instead of 1Darray 
  -> then reproduce all the 1Darray functions using the already implemented method decorator 
  -> Then rewrite all the tests to test both (1Dlist and 1Darray) methods.
  -> Finish writing the tests for the second boxmodelsystem (boxmodelsystem2)
  -> Write the Solver
  -> Write general plotting interface within the Solution class
  -> Reevaluate the project
  
  
- Define the boxmodelsystem2. And write tests for it. Implement all methods and things that are needed that is works.
- make interface with the rate lambda functions nicer: at the moment if the user wants to access the conditions of other boxes very long expressions have to be types: for example:  c.box_upper_ocean.cond.T 
- make nice plot interface
- incorporate processes and fluxes
- incorporate reactions
- make reactions stop if one of the educts is not available anymore
- make gui
- stability criterion for timesteps?!
- Think about a way to calculate the timestep more efficient:
