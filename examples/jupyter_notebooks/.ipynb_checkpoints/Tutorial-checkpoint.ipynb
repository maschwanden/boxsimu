    "boxsimu is a simple modelling framework based on the principle of a system of discrete boxes interacting with each other. boxsimu offers a simple interface to define a system, its components and properties. The system definition is done by instantiating several classes of the boxsimu package like **Box**, **Fluid**, **Flow**, **Flux**, **Process**, **Reaction**, or **Box**. The temporal evolution of a system defined in boxsimu can then easily be simulated and the output of the simulation can be visualized or further investigated."

Once an instance of BoxModelSystem is built, its temporal evolution can be simulated using the instance's 'solve' method.\n",
    "- **Box**: Represents a compartement of the system. Contains information about the mass of variables and fluid within the represented compartement and which processes and reaction take place. Additionally for every box an 'environmental condition' (instance of the class Condition) can be defined. These conditions (e.g. the pH or the temperature within the box) in turn can then be used by user-defined rate functions (dynamic rates of processes/reactions/flows/fluxes/fluid-densities that can be dependent on the condition of the box). \n",
    "- **Flow**: Represent a transport of a fluid between two boxes. This flow can passively transport variables (e.g. a river that passively transport a lot of different chemical substances) but doesn't have to (e.g. evaporation from a lake into the atmosphere where almost pure water is transported).\n",
    "- **Flux**: Represents a transport of a variable that is not associated with a flow of a fluid. Examples of fluxes are for example: sedimentation of particles in a sea/ocean/atmosphere.\n",
    "- **Variable**: Variables are tracer within the system which time evolution is simulated. Thus variables are quantites within the system that are of direct or indirect interst to the user.\n",
    "- **Process**: Represents sink or source mechanisms of a certain variable.\n",
    "- **Reaction**: Represents transformations between different variables. There is no mass conservation constraint. Thus a ''transformation'' of approximately 1kg of phosphate into 114kg of phytoplankton (approx. Redfield ratio) is a valid reaction."

    "But before we dive into the details of the code, have a quick look at the sequence of definitions of boxsimu classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first step, instances of the classes **Fluid** and **Variable** are instantiated. \n",
    "A fluids represents the solvent of a box in which variables can be dissolved (e.g. for a lake the fluid is water, in which a myrade of chemicals can be dissolved).\n",
    "A box can, but doesn't have to be filled with a fluid. This allows to also simulate quantites that are not typically dissolved (e.g. to simulate a population of animals).\n",
    "Variables are quantities of the system that are of interest to the user and that are simulated. A variable defined for one box, flow, flux, process, or reaction will be present in all boxes.\n",
    "At the time of instantiation (creation of the instance) instances of the classes Fluid and Variable are not quantified, that means the instances contain no information on the mass of fluid or variable they represent. However, before they are passed to an instance of the class Box they need to be quantified. This is done by calling the method ''q(mass)'' for a fluid or variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simple lake system the fluids and variables are:\n",
    "- Fluid: The freshwater that is present in the lake (see line 2 in the code).\n",
    "- Variable: Phosphate whose concentration we want to analyse as a function of time (see line 5 in the code). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, if needed, the classes **Process** and **Reaction** are instantiated (created). However, in this simple lake system there are no processes and no reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The created instances of Fluid, Variable, Process, and Reaction are then assigned to instances of the class **Box** that represent a compartement in the system (see lines 14-19 in the code).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a next step we have to define how the boxes in our system interact with each other and with the environement (outside the system). That means how the boxes are exchaning mass of fluids and variables. Therefore we instantiate the classes **Flow** and **Flux** (see lines 22-40 in the code).\n",
    "The difference between a flow and a flux is that flows represent a transport of fluid that again can (but doesn't have to) passively transport dissolved variables, whereas fluxes represent a transport of variables that is not associated with any fluid transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we create an instance of the class **BoxModelSystem** that glues together all elements of the system (see lines 43-46 in the following code)."
